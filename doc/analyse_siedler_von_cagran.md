# Things we noticed during game-testing as a group:

## Meta

Meta: **it would have been better for the analysis to be there for an evening** / rest here is mostly guesswork

## Goal

goal: get creative ideas / [raumverteilungen]

some guidelines / principles one could follow:

* strengthen minecraft-style self-realisation / creative activity
* make simulation more realistic and the scoring clearer / the causality behind it clearer

## Misc 

position and placement has more effect on the agents than size (is there a "capacity" of people attractions can hold?)

is it modelled that people read signs at the entrance (and go where they want to be) or are there for a specific reason/location(?) / theming of different walkways

play button - don't think of token-placing as clicks (but more closely related to a convenient click&hold if it at all)
{Build into game}

basic clarity with scoring: place a score-bar somewhere (atm 1 pos / 1 neg bar) - 1 graph

* game: might need some form of scoring?
    * requires full play-through by same player → rounds should be short
    * or at least the effect of one's actions toward the score should be clear
    * see net-difference 

starting mood: people occasionally arrive grumpy / happy (only score difference)

red-green! anyway: low-light setting. icons / strong contrasts might be better

level-design? gut, auch das dial ist gut gewählt (bzw die modifikatoren)

setup?


## clarity

tutorial shouldn't be necessary

setting where people rapidly join and leave might be impacting learning the thing (though they can probably say that better) → **improve clarity** (e.g. why someone is attracted or why an agent is leaving)

* red agents might be leaving too fast 
    * if you don't catch them on their way they're gone
    * drop notifications with paraphrased reason
    * allow interaction to display the agents path (and the places of attractors they've interacted with back then)
        * breaks the interaction

log actions and graph. calculate correlation of certain actions with good graph values to help identify effective moves


------

airhockey: += place 1-2 bumpers before (introduces phases), scoring bar somewhere, 

arcade mode game

same context (attraction, quick drop-in,...)

* leaderboard



**score-graph** → simple demo; coloring agents with a token → see graph changing
