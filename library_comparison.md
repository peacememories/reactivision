# Graphics Libraries

## Gloss

Gloss: Get some simple vector graphics on the screen with a minimum of fuss. Gloss comes with a large number of examples in the gloss-examples package.
Gloss-raster: Renders raster images in parallel using the Repa array library. Gloss-raster can be used as a partial replacement for the "Processing" Java library.

Simple vector graphics (lines, polygons, arcs)

## LambdaCube 3D

LambdaCube 3D is a domain specific language and library that makes it possible to program GPUs in a purely functional style.

* opengl
* bullet boiler-plate sample

## Hieroglyph

Hieroglyph is a pure-functional 2D graphics library focused on visualization.

verrry basic (path, string and that's it)

## Diagrams

documentation: <http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/manual.html>

* declarative diagrams
* can render to screen
* has event-listeners
* uses cairo as backend

# Rendering Essential

## GPipe

A functional graphics API for programmable GPUs.

functional-programming replacement for OpenGL

shaders written in haskell

## HOpenGL 

is a Haskell binding for the OpenGL graphics API (GL 2.1 / GLU 1.3) and the portable OpenGL utility toolkit GLUT.

## hsSDL

Contains bindings to libSDL, libSDL_gfx, libSDL_image, libSDL_mixer and libSDL_ttf.


## Milfoh

An image to texture loading library. Use SDL_image (and a bare minimum of SDL), to load image files as OpenGL textures.











# FRP

## Reflex

## [Reactive Banana]()

provides SDL bindings -> very basic

## Grapefruit

Grapefruit is a library for programming graphical animations and GUIs in a declarative way. It is based on the concepts of Functional Reactive Programming.
